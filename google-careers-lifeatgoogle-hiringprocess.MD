Core of how we hire/ Noogler
	Things move quickly at Internet speed at Google.
	good for Google, for the long term.
		smart
		team-oriented
		get things done
		good for the role,
		be nimble both in how we work.
		be nimble both in how we hire.		nimble -- quick and light in movement or action; agile
		great (at lots of things)***
		love big challenges and
		welcome big changes.
			not too many specialists, in just one particular area.

Interview process/ path to getting hired
	usually involves
		a first conversation with a recruiter, a phone interview and an onsite (interviews)*** at one of our offices.
		a few things make getting hired at Google a little different.

How we interview
	You’ll likely interview with 4 or 5 Googlers.

	They’re looking for 4 things:
	
		Leadership
			how you flexed different muscles
				in different situations
					in order to mobilize a team?      	(((((((((mobilize -- prepare and organize (troops) for active service)))))))))
			when not officially appointed as the leader.
				asserting a leadership role  			(((((((((assert -- state a fact or belief confidently and forcefully.)))))))))
					at work or
					with an organization, or
					by helping a team succeed

		Role-Related Knowledge
			have a variety of strengths and passions, not just isolated skill sets.
			have the experience and the background that will set you up for success in your role.
			engineering candidates? have coding skills & technical areas of expertise.

		How You Think
			more interested? how you think.
				role-related answers that provide insight into how you solve problems.
				Show how to tackle the problem presented--don’t get hung up on nailing the “right” answer.
			less concerned? about grades and transcripts

		Googleyness
			Show a feel of what makes you?
			We also want to make sure this is a place you’ll thrive,
				so we’ll be looking for signs around your comfort with ambiguity,
				your bias to action and
				your collaborative nature.


How we decide

		Hiring the right candidate for the right role and for Google.

		We collect feedback from multiple Googlers

		you work on tons of projects with
			different groups of Googlers,
			across many teams and time zones.
				some of your interviewers could be potential teammates,
				some interviewers will be with other teams.
				helps Google to see how you might
						collaborate and fit in
						overall.

		Independent committees of Googlers help us ensure
			we’re hiring for the long term

		An independent committee of Googlers
			review feedback
			from all of the interviewers.
				This committee is responsible for
					ensuring our hiring process is
						fair and
						that we’re holding true to our “good for Google” standards as we grow.

		We believe that if you hire great people and
			involve them intensively in the hiring process,
			you’ll get more great people.
			Over the past couple of years,
				we’ve spent a lot of time
					making our hiring process as efficient as possible
						reducing time-to-hire and
						increasing our communications to candidates.
							While involving Googlers in our process does take longer, we believe it’s worth it.
							Our early Googlers identified these principles more than ten years ago, and
								it’s what allows us to hold true
									to who we are
									as we grow.

	These core principles are true across Google,
		but when it comes to specifics,
			there are some pieces of our process that	
				look a little different across teams.
			Our recruiters can help you navigate through these as the time comes.

		At Google, we don’t just accept difference - we celebrate it, we support it, and we thrive on it for
			the benefit of	our employees,
							our products and
							our community.
			Google is proud to be
				an equal opportunity workplace and (((((((the aim is that important jobs should go to those "most qualified" – persons most likely to perform ably in a given task – and not go to persons for arbitrary or irrelevant reasons, such as circumstances of birth, upbringing, having well-connected relatives or friends,[3] religion, sex,[4] ethnicity,[4] race, caste,[5] or involuntary personal attributes such as disability, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation.))))))
				is an affirmative action employer. (((((((affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.)))))))

code
	+ basic ds/algorithms
		how to use & apply
			to different algorithms
		what
			ll
			heap
			hash table
				not implement
				but know how it works
					dont have to prove big O
						but still know how they work and say that
		how they work
		why use them
		why use one over other
			ds is MUST
				right ds is best
				sub optimal is ok
		practice
			if 10+ may use custom ds
				so practice basic ds
			write on
				whiteboad
				notebook
			no pseudocode
				write real code
			c++/java/c		javascript(UI)		python
		
		most important
			(interviewer cannot read your mind?)
			how you approach the problem
			how you work
				work & finalAnswer are equal
			tell what you are thinking/ brainstrom
				did you understand the problem?
				how you think through the problem
				work through the problem
					helps interviewer
						to have a clear idea of
							what step in the process you are at
							what you are thinking is super important
								possibly, to guide you
								or, you are already on right track
			questions are in-depth, they
				won't have an easy solution
				might have a simple solution
				most have
						simple inefficient solution
						also a better one
					OR
						wont have a simple solution
							then, we expand it to cover other situations
								how you work
								how you approach the problem
									like, given the 1st solution
									how you expand it to other roles - SUPER IMPORTANT
				take problem
				understand it
				break it down
				solve it
				
				problem
					what is given?
						given1
						given2
						given3
					what are your assumptions?
						assumption1
						assumption2
						assumption3
					record change in assumption? - (gets complicated question)
						assumption1 to assumption11 changed, what else changed?
						assumption2 to assumption21 changed, what else changed?
						assumption3 to assumption31 changed, what else changed?
				give a solution
					change it to make it better, as possible (better solution is more complicated)
						these will fill more time in interview
						don't worry if you reach the end of question
				
				1. how well you handled different questions
				2. what you know
				
				sample question:
					peanutbutter	--> peanut butter
							questions are under specified
								for a reason
									what questions will you ask to answer it?
							so, dont write the code, right away
							ask questions as you have/ figure out some of these constraints are
					clarify the problem
						fastman -- "fast man"
					disambiguate the expected result
							TEST CASES:
								a) what if we have multiple words
									interviewer answer may be: it might not do that
								a2) what if one word
								b) what if we have empty string (no words)
									interviewer answer may be: it wont do anything
								c) what if we have NULL string
								d) all numbers?
								*) if interviewer gave examples, then run through them, there is a reason why they gave
								-) edge cases (VERY IMPORTANT) - make sure recursion terminates
							it shows that you understand, how to solve this problem
							
							understand the problem
							show you understand the problem
							make sure interviewer and you are thinking about same problem/solution
								avoid the communication problem
					state and clarify key assumptions
						expected result?
						any memory/ speed requirements?
						where do the words come from?
							interviewer answer may be: use a dictionary (or other)
					clarify the function signature
					
				start with first solution that comes to mind
					may be, straightforward, not optimal solution/ brute force/ n squared solution
					we get
						code sample
						interesting conversation
					run through initial 2/3 examples to check (VERY IMPORTANT)
						pretend you are a debugger (any < instead of >?, etc.)
						check (TEST CASES) above
					have reasonable variables names
					clean up the code
					
					ask the interviewer if they have any questions
						may be, gives an edge case
						what's the run time of this
							memory usage
							
				refine the solution?
					faster solution
						 O (N logN) to N OR  logN
					more details of questions cane come in: peanut could be "pea nut" too
					i know there is a way, dont remember what it is (may be .length OR .size?, etc.)
						dont worry
							if you dont know the name of api
							if you dont know how api behaves
								ask
					what if dictionary cant fit in memory
					what is the idea of how to approach the problem (ok if can't code), that works for scale that's pretty big for Google?
					when multiple solutions, what is most likely solution? 		peanutbutter -- pea nut butter   OR peanut butter?
					what if words are spelled incorrectly? (super advanced problem) - some kind of spell check algorithm
					
					good interview is a really jus a conversation between two engineers
						you have a problem
						you kind of work through the problem
						you talk about different solutions
							here is the problem
							i understand how to solve it
							this is kind of what i want to do
							does this sound good?
				optimizing solution
					see if you can come up with reasonably efficient one than naive solution
					optimize time
					optimize space
					pre-compute things?
						is that a reasonable idea?
					what if input is significantly bigger?
						doesn't fit in the memory?
					max length given of dictionary word
					max length given of word to break?
				api
					forgot name OR behaviour?
						just ask
				testing
					interview given tests?
					which tests can fail, under different circumstances?	off by 1
				
				know ds
					binary tree
				college grads/ industry experience
					
analytical skills
	how you approach
	neveer seen, how you adapt
sound design
	do while writing code
		understand limit
			or corner cases
			error checking
	null or zero
		make note
		also write code
	clean like-production grade code

Google's Recruiter on How to Build a Superstar Team

Todd Carlisle, staffing director for our business teams, knows to look for people who can think quick on their feet. He talks about the best ways to build a fantastic team through finding candidates with the "startup" mentality - raw intellect, learning agility, diversity, leadership and innovation.

https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/217877
Carlisle looks for
	raw intellect,
	learning agility,
	diversity,
	leadership and
	innovation in résumés--but
		to find that startup mentality, he says,
		you have to ask the right questions during the interview.

Finally, you have to want to take them out to lunch after the interview.
It's important to hire leaders who play well with others,
	so ask about their experiences working on a team.
	Their bragging that they convinced everyone else that they were right or
		taking credit for everything are big red flags.

Carlisle also asks candidates to talk of a time they really screwed up--and that whole spin-your-weaknesses-into-strengths strategy won't cut it.
	"You have to be humble and talk about what you learned, because you don't win all the time," he says. "That's not how real life works."

"What's motivating you right now and
	how can I give you more of that?"

"People's needs--money, promotions, cool projects--will change," he says, "but if you give them what they want, your staff won't." (((((((quit?)))))))
